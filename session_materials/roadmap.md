# Session Setup & Repo Initialization (Documented)

## Repository Creation
- Created new repo: https://github.com/coplilot-demos/landing-page-demo
- Initialized with folders: /src, /public, /.github/workflows, /session_materials
- Added .gitignore to exclude /session_materials from version control

## Documentation
- All planning and workflow documentation is stored in /session_materials (not tracked by git)

# Copilot-First Roadmap: End-to-End Landing Page Dev & Deployment

## 1. Session Objectives

- Build and deploy a modern, responsive landing page using a popular JS framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.).
- Demonstrate Copilot Pro’s strengths: prompt engineering, chat, coding agent, and workflow automation.
- Deliver a repo that’s easy to edit, well-documented, and CI/CD-enabled.
- Empower attendees to replicate, contribute, and continuously improve the project using Copilot.

---

## 2. Roadmap & Flow

### Phase 1: Kickoff & Copilot Introduction
- Introduce session goals and tools (modern JS frameworks, GitHub Pages, Copilot Pro).
- Briefly explain Copilot’s capabilities: code generation, chat, agent, and prompt engineering.
- Show the current landing page and repo as a reference.

### Phase 2: Planning with Copilot
- Use Copilot chat to brainstorm requirements and wireframe ideas.
- Prompt Copilot to generate a feature list and initial project structure.
- Discuss modularity, responsiveness, accessibility, and maintainability.

### Phase 3: Repo Setup (Copilot-Driven)
- Create a new repo (or fork for demo).
- Use Copilot to scaffold the project with the chosen framework.
- Prompt Copilot to generate:
  - `/src` folder with starter components, styles, and assets.
  - `/public` folder with static files.
  - `.github/workflows` for CI/CD.
  - `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` with clear, Copilot-generated instructions.

### Phase 4: Development (Copilot in Action)
- Use Copilot to:
  - Scaffold main page structure and components.
  - Generate responsive layouts and accessibility features.
  - Refactor code for best practices.
- Demonstrate prompt engineering:
  - Show how to ask Copilot for specific features (“Add a responsive navbar”, “Make the contact form accessible”).
  - Use Copilot chat for troubleshooting and code explanations.
- Encourage iterative refinement: review, edit, and improve Copilot output.

### Phase 5: Documentation & Contribution (Copilot-Assisted)
- Use Copilot to draft and expand documentation.
- Generate CONTRIBUTING.md and issue templates with Copilot.
- Document how to replicate, edit, and contribute to the project.

### Phase 6: CI/CD & Deployment (Copilot-Enabled)
- Use Copilot to set up GitHub Actions workflow for auto-deploy to GitHub Pages.
- Prompt Copilot to explain the workflow and deployment process.
- Trigger a deployment and show live update.

### Phase 7: Live Copilot Agent Demo
- Create a simple issue (e.g., “Change button color”).
- Assign Copilot agent, show prompt and workflow.
- Merge Copilot’s PR live for visual impact.

### Phase 8: Q&A, Next Steps, and Resources
- Invite questions and feedback.
- Share repo link and documentation.
- Announce future sessions and encourage contributions.
